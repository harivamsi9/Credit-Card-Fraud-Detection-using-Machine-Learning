# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Credit Card Fraud Detection using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor and their comparison. 
This is achieved through the outlier detection technique, and we use two algorithms namely Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor.

Our final output will show the precision values for both the algorithms, so that we can judge which is doing better at detecting fraudulent cases

I suggest to have anaconda jupyter notebook installed, since I have made this project on that you can
view my comments, codes, and notes better. link: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
